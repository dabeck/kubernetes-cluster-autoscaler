# This is a sample plugin structure

This code sample use AWS Go SDK to provide an idea about how to write a plugin for Kubernetes cluster auto scalar.

Plugin should have `ModifyEventAnalyzer` and `DeleteEventAnalyzer` main function. Main `autoscalar` will search for these two functions in the plugin.

Build the plugin,

```sh
go build -buildmode=plugin -o AWS.so main.go
```
